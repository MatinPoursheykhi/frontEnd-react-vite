# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is a simple frontEnd project based on REACT accompanied by TAILWIND. Also its dataBase can be on two ways,
1.first way is using json-server {https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server}, which is set on a specific port.
2.second way is backEnd,you can also use your local dataBase which must be sqlServer or mysql,
you can find this mentioned backEnd on my gitHub => (MatinPoursheykhi/backEnd-nodeJs-sequelize)
and clone it.

** you may need to change your dataBase, thus the infrastructures are provided to switch between json-server and your local dataBase.
